# Notice
_If you don't understand the code then fuck off, you won't be able to set it up & I won't help you._

### Remove noob blocker
	Remove the thing that stops HAC from loading

### Whitelists
For whitelists, when you join a majority of them will be automatically generated & placed into data/SID (username)/crc_type_*.txt
* crc_ccv_*.txt is for White_CCV
* crc_hook_*.txt is for White_Hooks
* crc_rq_*.txt is for White_Require
* crc_font_*.txt is for White_Font
* crc_ent_*.txt is for White_Ent
* crc_gm_*.txt is for White_GM
* crc_msg_*.txt is for White_PRT
* crc_r_*.txt is for White_DGR

### LPT
 While you're generating your whitelists, you'll probably see yourself being detected for LPT, copy/paste that into whatever file it's from into sv_lpt.lua into the correct string

## Might support win64/linux64 soon, probably not.
