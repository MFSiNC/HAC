=== HeX's AntiCheat ===
"A good attempt at something impossible"

I started work on this project as "NoBB" (No BaconBot) in 2009, my first lua prject.
It's got better and better over time and is now the best GMod anti-cheat as far as i can tell.

Almost all servers that have a custom AC have stolen code from HAC. So here, go nuts.


Folders:
    ./DevStuff                        - Code snippets, test versions etc
    ./Old_Versions                    - Every old old version of HAC
    ./addons
        ./Adv Duplicator HAC107       - Patched Adv Duplicator to check all ents with HAC
        ./HAC106                      - Live version of HAC, straight from the UHDM
    ./v13b                            - Old attempt at fixing it for GM13
        ./HAC107beta                  - Latest version, for GMod 13, never finished, last code
        ./R&D                         - Code snippets, planned features etc
        ./cl_CarePackage.lua          - Fun and games
        ./HAC.lua                     - Work file, notes, features to add, snippets etc
```
